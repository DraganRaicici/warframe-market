# Warframe Market

This is a revamp of the old http://warframe.market website.

The design is NOT my own! All design credits go to the 42Bytes team, who made the design of the website and I am only implementing it based on that design.

This is a hobby project and a means to learn what is new in the Play 2.6 framework, as well as also enhance my own knowledge by experimenting with new trends not only concerning the frameowrk.

# Note:
Since I started working on this project, the revamped version of the Warframe Market was only a design and it has been teased for about 2 years. reason why I decided to start working on it.

To my surprise, the new Warframe Market design is now fully implemented and fully functioning by the original team who designed it and caught me off-guard. I will continue the development since I still find it challenging and will put my own spin on certain aspects and also include features that the current design does not have.
